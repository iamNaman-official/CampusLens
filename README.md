# CampusLens

> AI-powered document understanding for students.

## Hackathon Build It demo

CampusLens has an implemented local Build It workflow using the Strands Agents
SDK and Ollama. See [the Build It submission guide](docs/BUILD_IT_SUBMISSION.md)
for the exact local architecture, demo steps, and an honest submission
checklist. Cloud deployment configuration in this repository is future work and
must not be represented as deployed functionality.

CampusLens is an AI-powered document understanding system designed to help students deal with confusing college documents such as:

- College circulars
- Exam notifications
- Syllabi
- Scholarship notices
- Fee notices
- Internship opportunities
- Hostel notices
- Academic announcements
- Other student-related PDFs

Instead of simply allowing a student to chat with a PDF, CampusLens focuses on turning documents into **clear information and actionable tasks**.

---

## 🎯 Problem

Students receive a large number of college documents, but important information is often buried inside long and confusing PDFs.

A student may need to manually search for:

- What is this document about?
- What do I need to do?
- What is the deadline?
- What documents do I need?
- Where do I submit something?
- How much do I need to pay?
- Which information applies to me?
- Where in the document was this information mentioned?

Missing one important sentence can result in a missed deadline or incomplete submission.

---

## 💡 Solution

CampusLens converts a document into:

```text
PDF
 │
 ▼
Understand
 │
 ├── Summary
 ├── Deadlines
 ├── Required Actions
 ├── Important Information
 ├── Q&A
 └── Source / Page References
```

The main interaction is:

> **"Tell me what I need to do."**

For example:

```text
📄 Exam Circular

Summary:
End-semester examination registration is now open.

Important deadlines:
• Registration: 20 October
• Fee payment: 22 October

Required actions:
1. Complete the examination registration form.
2. Pay the examination fee.
3. Upload the required photograph.
4. Download the confirmation/admit card.

Sources:
• Registration deadline — Page 2
• Fee payment deadline — Page 2
• Photograph requirement — Page 3
```

If the requested information is not present in the document, CampusLens should clearly say:

```text
I couldn't find this information in the uploaded document.
```

rather than inventing an answer.

                  Supporting services:
                    IAM + CloudWatch
```

Planned AWS components:

- Amazon Bedrock
- Strands Agents SDK
- Amazon S3
- IAM
- CloudWatch
- Container deployment infrastructure
- Frontend hosting

Only services that solve an actual project requirement should be introduced.

# 👥 Team Setup

## ⚠️ READ THIS BEFORE STARTING

Every teammate must create their **own local development environment**.

Each developer must have their own:

- `.env`
- Django `SECRET_KEY`
- `db.sqlite3`
- Django superuser
- JWT tokens

### Never share these between teammates.

Do not commit:

```text
.env
db.sqlite3
.venv/
AWS credentials
JWT tokens
secret keys
```

The repository contains `.env.example` as a safe configuration template.

---

# 🛠️ Backend Local Setup

## 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd CampusLens
```

---

## 2. Enter the backend

```bash
cd backend
```

---

## 3. Create your own virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate it on Linux/macOS:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Windows:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

## 4. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 5. Create your own `.env`

Create:

```text
backend/.env
```

Example:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your-own-secret-key
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=127.0.0.1,localhost
AWS_REGION=ap-south-1
```

Generate a secure Django secret key:

```bash
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
```

Copy the generated value into:

```env
SECRET_KEY=...
```

Do not use another teammate's secret key.

---

# 🗄️ Local Database

Each teammate has their own SQLite database.

Run:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

This creates:

```text
backend/db.sqlite3
```

You do **not** need another teammate's database.

Do not commit `db.sqlite3`.

---

# 👤 Create Your Own Superuser

Create your own Django admin account:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Enter your own:

```text
Username
Email
Password
```

Do not use another teammate's superuser account.

---

# ✅ Verify Backend

Run:

```bash
python manage.py check
```

Then:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Backend:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

API:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/
```

Django admin:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
```

---

# 🔐 Authentication

CampusLens currently uses JWT authentication.

## Obtain token

```http
POST /api/auth/token/
```

Example:

```json
{
    "username": "your-username",
    "password": "your-password"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
    "refresh": "...",
    "access": "..."
}
```

Use the access token for protected APIs:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access-token>
```

Every teammate should generate their own token using their own account.

---

# 📡 Current API

Base URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/
```

## Authentication

```text
POST /api/auth/register/
POST /api/auth/token/
POST /api/auth/token/refresh/
GET  /api/auth/me/
```

## Documents

```text
GET    /api/documents/
POST   /api/documents/
GET    /api/documents/<id>/
DELETE /api/documents/<id>/
GET    /api/documents/<id>/insights/
```

## Chats

```text
GET    /api/documents/<document_id>/chats/
POST   /api/documents/<document_id>/chats/
GET    /api/chats/<id>/
DELETE /api/chats/<id>/
GET    /api/chats/<chat_id>/messages/
POST   /api/chats/<chat_id>/messages/
```

For complete request and response contracts, see `docs/API.md`.


# 📄 Document Upload

Upload documents using:

```text
multipart/form-data
```

Required fields:

```text
title
file
```

Example:

```text
title = Exam Circular
file = exam_circular.pdf
```

### Important

Do **not** send:

```text
user
```

The backend automatically determines document ownership from:

```text
request.user
```

This means users can only access their own documents.

---

# 🧪 Testing

The backend uses pytest and pytest-django.

Run the complete suite from `backend/`:

```bash
pytest -v
```

Current coverage:

```text
Authentication       3/3
Documents            3/3
Chats                6/6
Security             7/7
Chat service         2/2
Document processing  2/2
──────────────────────────────
Total               23/23
```

Expected result:

```text
23 passed
```

The AI service is mocked in AI-dependent tests, so Ollama does not need to be running for the automated suite.

- Empty states

Use mock AI responses until the actual AI API is available.

The frontend should communicate with:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/
```

---

# 3. AWS / DevOps

Responsible for:

- AWS account/project setup
- IAM
- Amazon S3
- Amazon Bedrock access
- AWS environment configuration
- CloudWatch
- Deployment
- Production environment

### Security

Never commit:

```text
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

```

or any other credentials.

Use environment variables or appropriate AWS credential mechanisms.

---

# 4. AI / RAG / QA

Responsible for:

- PDF extraction experiments
- Chunking
- Retrieval
- Prompt design
- Strands research
- Bedrock model testing
- Deadline extraction
- Action extraction
- Q&A evaluation
- Source/page attribution
- AI response quality testing

Start simple.

The first retrieval implementation does not need a complicated vector database.

---

# 🔄 Parallel Development

The team should work in parallel.

```text
                       ┌── Frontend
                       │
                       ├── AWS / DevOps
main ──────────────────┼── AI / RAG
                       │
                       └── Backend
```

Nobody should wait for the entire project to be completed before starting.

For example:

```text
Frontend
   ↓
Build UI using mock data
   ↓
Connect APIs when available
```

Similarly:

```text
AI/RAG
   ↓
Test PDF extraction independently
   ↓
Test retrieval
   ↓
Connect to backend
```

---

# 🌿 Git Workflow

Do not directly develop on `main`.

Before starting:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

Create a feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature
```

Examples:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/frontend-dashboard
```

```bash
git checkout -b feature/bedrock-agent
```

```bash
git checkout -b feature/aws-deployment
```

---

# 💾 Commit Workflow

After completing a logical piece of work:

```bash
git add .
```

Commit:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add frontend dashboard"
```

Push:

```bash
git push -u origin feature/frontend-dashboard
```

Then open a Pull Request into:

```text
main
```

---

# 📌 Branches

Recommended branches:

```text
main
│
├── feature/backend
├── feature/frontend
├── feature/aws
└── feature/rag
```

If a feature needs a more specific branch, create one from the latest `main`.

---

# ⚠️ Before Creating a Pull Request

Check:

```bash
git status
```

Make sure you did not accidentally include:

```text
.env
db.sqlite3
.venv/
__pycache__/
AWS credentials
JWT tokens
```

Run:

```bash
python manage.py check
```

Run tests when available:

```bash
pytest
```

Then push your branch and create the PR.

---

# 🔒 Security Rules

Never commit:

```text
.env
db.sqlite3
.venv/
*.pyc
__pycache__/
AWS credentials
API keys
JWT tokens
private credentials
```

Never hard-code secrets in Python source code.

Use:

```text
.env
```

for local development.

Use appropriate AWS/IAM mechanisms for deployed environments.

---

# 🧠 AI Design

The initial AI architecture uses one agent.

```text
User
 │
 ▼
Django API
 │
 ▼
Strands Agent
 │
 ├── search_document()
 ├── structured document insights
 └── conversation history
 │
 ▼
Local: Ollama
AWS: Amazon Bedrock
 │
 ▼
Answer + Sources
```

The agent should answer from document evidence, preserve source/page references, understand follow-up questions, and avoid unsupported claims.

If the document does not contain enough information, CampusLens should say:

```text
I couldn't find this information in the uploaded document.
```


# 📚 Document Understanding Pipeline

```text
Upload PDF
    ↓
Validate PDF
    ↓
Extract Text
    ↓
Create Document Pages
    ↓
Chunk Text
    ↓
Extract Deadlines
    ↓
Extract Important Dates
    ↓
Extract Required Actions
    ↓
Persist Structured Data
    ↓
Retrieve Relevant Chunks
    ↓
Strands Agent
    ↓
AI Answer + Source Pages
```

The system preserves page numbers throughout processing so that extracted information and AI answers can point back to the original document.


# 🎯 MVP

The MVP should solve one problem well:

> **Help a student understand a college document and know what they need to do.**

Minimum flow:

```text
Student
   ↓
Upload PDF
   ↓
CampusLens processes document
   ↓
Summary
   ↓
Deadlines
   ↓
Required Actions
   ↓
Ask Questions
   ↓
Get source/page references
```

Example:

```text
Student:
"What do I need to do before the deadline?"

CampusLens:

Required actions:
1. Fill the registration form.
2. Upload your photograph.
3. Pay the required fee.

Deadline:
20 October 2026

Sources:
Page 2
Page 3
```

---

# 🚫 What We Are NOT Building Initially

Do not expand the MVP unnecessarily.

Avoid initially building:

- Complex multi-agent systems
- Large-scale university knowledge graphs
- Complicated vector databases
- Full email ingestion
- Calendar automation
- Mobile applications
- Advanced personalization
- Large-scale notification systems
- Multiple AI providers
- Complex microservices

These can become future features if time allows.

---

# 🔮 Future Features

Possible future improvements:

- Hindi/Gujarati support
- OCR for scanned documents
- Email document ingestion
- Calendar integration
- Deadline reminders
- Personalized student profiles
- Multiple document reasoning
- University-specific knowledge base
- Automatic notifications
- Document comparison
- Mobile application
- Advanced agent workflows
- Offline-first capabilities

These are **not required for the initial MVP**.

---

# 🧪 Quality Requirements

CampusLens should prioritize correctness over simply generating fluent AI responses.

The AI should:

### 1. Use document evidence

Answers should be based on the uploaded document.

### 2. Avoid hallucination

If information is unavailable:

```text
I couldn't find this information in the uploaded document.
```

### 3. Show sources

Whenever possible:

```text
Source: Page 2
```

### 4. Extract actionable information

The system should prioritize:

```text
What?
When?
Who?
Where?
How?
What must I submit?
What must I pay?
What is the deadline?
```

---

# 📖 Documentation

Additional documentation is available in:

```text
docs/
├── API.md
├── ARCHITECTURE.md
└── TEAM.md
```

### `docs/API.md`

Contains API contracts and endpoint information.

### `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
