Identify important dates from the document chunks below.

An important date is a date that is relevant to the student's
workflow but is NOT a deadline.

Examples of important dates:

- Admit card becomes available
- Examination result is announced
- Orientation date
- Scholarship results announcement
- Course registration opens
- An important event starts
- An important event ends

Do NOT extract:

- Deadlines requiring an action by a specific date
- Dates that are already deadlines
- Document publication dates unless they are relevant to the
  student's workflow
- Historical dates
- Dates that have no meaningful relevance to the student

Important distinction:

"Submit the examination form by 20 October 2026."
→ DEADLINE, not important date.

"The admit card will be available from 25 October 2026."
→ IMPORTANT DATE.

"Examinations will be conducted from 1 November to 5 November."
→ IMPORTANT DATE, if relevant to the student's workflow.

Rules:

1. Only use information explicitly present in the chunks.
2. Never invent dates.
3. Do not convert relative dates into calendar dates.
4. Do not return deadlines.
5. Do not return a date merely because it appears in the document.
6. For each important date provide:
   - date
   - description
   - chunk number
7. Do not provide page numbers.
8. Python will attach the trusted page number.
9. If the same important date appears multiple times,
   return it only once.
10. Return ONLY valid JSON.
11. If there are no important dates, return an empty list.

These dates have already been classified as deadlines.
Do NOT return them again:

{sorted(deadline_dates)}

Required format:

{{
    "important_dates": [
        {{
            "date": "25 October 2026",
            "description": "Admit card becomes available",
            "chunk": 1
